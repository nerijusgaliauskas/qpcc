QPCC (Quadratic Programming with Complementarity Constraints) is a set of Fortran 90 subroutines devoted to find a local (qpcc_l) and a global (qpcc_g, qpcc_pg) minimizers of a certain function arising in multidimensional scaling with city-block distances. More info about this optimization problem and the proposed algorithms, see the file thesis.pdf.
